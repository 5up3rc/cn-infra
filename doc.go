// Package cninfra (cloud-native infrastructure) is a Golang platform for building cloud-native microservices.
// This platform is extensible by implementing plugins. Out of the box there are implemented reusable plugins for:
// logging, health checks, messaging (e.g. Kafka), a common front-end API and back-end connectivity
// to various data stores (Etcd, Cassandra, Redis, ...), and REST and gRPC APIs.
