# Examples

Put all examples under [/examples/*](../../examples) folder.
This folder should contain minimalistic examples that are ideally oriented
to a single feature.

Examples that are really just a skeleton (or archetype) for a specific type of microservice
should be pushed to the dedicated GIT repository
[ligato/cn-sample-service](https://github.com/ligato/cn-sample-service).
